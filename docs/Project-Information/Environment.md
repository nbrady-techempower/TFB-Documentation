 #Simulating Production Environments
 For this project, we aimed to configure every framework according to the best
practices for production deployments gleaned from documentation and popular
community opinion. The goal is approximating a sensible production deployment
as accurately as possible. We also want this project to be as transparent as
possible, which is why we have posted our test suites on
[GitHub](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/).
