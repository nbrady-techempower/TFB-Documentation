 ##What does TechEmpower have to do with the Framework Benchmarks?
 
 In a [March 2013 blog
entry](https://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/03/28/frameworks-round-1/),
TechEmpower published the results of comparing the performance of several web
application frameworks executing simple but representative tasks: serializing
JSON objects and querying databases. The community reaction was terrific.
TechEmpower received dozens of comments, suggestions, questions, criticisms,
and most importantly, GitHub pull requests at the [repository TechEmpower set
up for this project](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/).
Since then, community input has been tremendous and the benchmarks now have
regular updates called "rounds" where test implementations are regularly
updated, and coverage is expanded.
