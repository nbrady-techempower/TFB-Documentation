Questions](../Project-Information/Expected-Questions.md) for more questions and
answers.__
 
 1. There is synthetic routing implemented for the platforms that do not provide
native routing. Should we force them to have similar routing logic to other
platforms?
 
     > It's up to you, but adding trivial synthetic routing shouldn't affect the
numbers to a measurable degree.
 
 2. Is there any data visualization for the results if one would like to look at
one's own results?
 
     > Yes, see
