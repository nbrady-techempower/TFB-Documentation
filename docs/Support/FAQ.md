1. There is synthetic routing implemented for the platforms that do not provide native routing. Should we force them to have similar routing logic to other platforms?

    > It's up to you, but adding trivial synthetic routing shouldn't affect the numbers to a measurable degree.

2. Is there any data visualization for the results if one would like to look at one's own results?

    > Yes, see [https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test).
