 ### deployment/
 
 Information for deploying the benchmark on a range of cloud or 
 self-hosted environments. While you can always use manual deployment, 
 automated scripts exist for many scenarios. Explinations of the 
 subdirectories are within 
 [Summary of Script Directories section](Summary-of-Script-Directories).
 
 ### frameworks/
 
 This directory contains all of the framework implementations of the 
 benchmarking suite tests. The general directory structure is Language 
 and then the framework name. The contents for the framework directory 
 range between each framework. However, there are a few files that are 
 similar. 
 
 For information on each language, there are individual READMEs within 
 their respective directory. 
 
 #### Language README.md
 
 Because the information for each language varies so much, each language 
 should have its own README. This should include information like which 
 software versions are used, special instructions for adding a new 
 framework in that language, and places where you can get help specific 
 to that language. See the [Language README Formatting
Guide](../Development/Readme-Formats#language-readmes) 
 for a more detailed guide.
 
 #### Framework README.md
 
 Because the information for each framework varies so much, each framework 
 should have its own README. This should include information like which 
 software versions are used, special instructions for adding a new 
 variation in that framework, and places where you can get help specific 
 to that framework. See the [Framework README Formatting
Guide](../Development/Readme-Formats#framework-readmes) 
 for a more detailed guide.
 
 #### Framework Specific Files
 
 Most of the files are framework specific and you can find more 
 information within their individual READMEs. However, there are two 
 files that are required by the TFB suite. These are:
 
 * benchmark_config.json
 * [test-name].dockerfile
 
 See the section on [Framework Specific Files](Framework-Files) 
 for more information.
 
 #### Source Code File
 
 The file named `source_code` within each framework is used to count the lines 
 of code in the project - each file listed in source_code has its lines counted 
 (we're using [CLOC](http://cloc.sourceforge.net/) to provide this
functionality)
 and the result are include in `results.json` under the rawData > slocCounts 
 keys, as shown here:
 
     "rawData": {
       "slocCounts": {
         "mojolicious": 72, 
         "scruffy": 47, 
         "nodejs": 217, 
         "spring": 242, 
         "cpoll-cppsp": 82, 
         "slim": 1889, 
         "dropwizard": 293, 
         "revel": 258, 
         "dancer": 32, 
 
 TFB does not use the numbers in any of the graphs but we include them for 
 other consumers of the data.
 
 _Note: The keys used are framework names (e.g. ringo) and not the framework 
 test names (e.g. ringojs-raw)._
 
 ### toolset/
 
 This directory contains the code that TFB uses to automate installing, 
 launching, load testing, and terminating each framework.
 
 #### benchmark/
 
 This directory contains files that implement or support the benchmark feature:
 
 * `benchmarker.py`: Benchmark execution methods. Called by `run-tests.py`.
 * `framework_test.py`: Methods to run a framework's tests. Called by
`benchmarker.py`.
 
 These files are not meant for you to run directly. For instructions on running
the 
 benchmark, please refer to the [benchmarking section](../Benchmarking).
 
 #### continuous/
 
 This directory contains the files required to run our continuous benchmarking.
 
 #### databases/
 
 This directory contains the configuration and dockerfiles for the databases we
support.
 
 #### scaffolding/
 
 This directory contains a script for quickly bootstrapping a new framework
test.
 
 #### travis/
 
 This directory is specifically for travis scripts.
 
 #### utils/
 
 This directory contains a set of helper utilities used by our benchmarking
tool.
 
 ### .travis.yml
 
 Provides Travis-CI with the relevant information to test TFB. See the 
 [Travis-CI](../Project-Information/Travis-CI) section for more information.
