 If you'd like to verify a certain test works, update a test, or 
 add a new test/framework, you're in the right place. 
 However, see the [benchmarking section](../Benchmarking) 
 if you're looking to run the full suite yourself.
 
 The community has consistently helped in making these tests better, 
 and we welcome any and all changes. Reviewing our contribution 
 practices and guidelines will help to keep us all on the same page.
