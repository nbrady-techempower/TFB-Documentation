 # General Guidelines
 
 These guidelines prevent us from having to give repeated feedback on 
 the same topics: 
 
 * __Use specific versions__: If you're updating any software or dependency,
please be specific with the version number. Also, update the
appropriate `README` to reflect that change. Don't rely on the package manager
to deliver a specific version, apt 
consistently returns different versions on Ubuntu 12.04 vs 14.04.
 * __Rope in experts__: If you're making a performance tweak, our team may not
be able to verify your code--we are not experts in every language. It's always
helpful to ping expert users to verify that the change is appropriate (a basic
introduction to someone with the appropriate credentials is also a plus).
If you're an expert that is willing to be pinged occasionally, please add
yourself to the appropriate test or language README file. 
 * __Use a personal Travis-CI account__: This one is mainly for your own sanity.
Our 
 [main Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks) can
occasionally become clogged with so many pull requests that it takes a day to
finish all the builds. If you create a fork and enable Travis-CI.org,
you will get your own build queue. This means 1) only your commits/branches
are being verified, so there is no delay waiting for an unrelated pull
request, and 2) you can cancel unneeded items. This does not affect our own
Travis-CI setup at all--any commits added to a pull
request will be verifed as normal. 
 * __Read the README__: We know that's cliche. However, our toolset drags in a
lot of different concepts and frameworks, and it can really help to read the
documentation and READMEs, such as this one, the ones inside specific language
directories, and the ones inside specific framework directories.
 * __Use the Development Virtual Machine__: Our Vagrant scripts can set up a VM
for you that looks nearly identical to our test environment. This is even
better than relying on the Travis-CI verification, and you are strongly
encouraged to use this. See the
[installation guide](Installation-Guide#vagrant-development-environment) 
for specifics.
 
 # Github Pull Request Procedure
 
 If you'd like to submit a pull request for this documentation, see the
 [about documentation page](../About/Documentation). Otherwise, follow the steps
 below.
 
 1. The branch that your branch will need to be based off of depends on the
 purpose of the pull request.
     * For a bug fix based on preview results, base your branch off of the 
     next TFB round branch (`round-#`).
     * For anything else, base your branch off of `master`. These changes will 
     show up in the following round, so if we are currently in preview for 
     Round 14, any changes merged into `master` will be reflected in the Round
      15 results.
     * __Note:__ if we are not currently in a preview for an official round
     release, there will be no `round-#` branch and all fixes can be branched
      off of `master`. 
 2. Submit your pull request from a branch in your
 [forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to make
 changes and submit a pull request.
 3. (optional) Clean up your commit(s) to provide future contributors with more
 helpful information. Some sugguestions are:
     * Squash your commits into a clean, single commit (remove in-progress
     commits).
     * Rewrite your commit messages to be as detailed as possible.
 4. Fetch and [rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) off
 of the appropriate TFB branch (`round-#` for a fix, `master` otherwise) prior
 to opening the pull request to ensure that your branch has the latest updates
 and a clean history.
 5. If your PR is fixing an issue,
 [tag the issue in the PR
body](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests)
 if you haven't done so in a commit. Just include the
 [special keyword
syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/),
 like "Resolves #1" and the issue will be automatically closed when your merge
 request is merged in.
 6. Open a PR from the branch on your repo with the target set to the
 appropriate TFB branch (`round-#` for a bugfix, `master` otherwise). The PR
 body will be prepopulated with a Pull Request Template explaining the
 appropriate branch to use, if you are unsure.
 
 # GitHub Issue Procedure
 * You can submit an issue for almost anything, but also consider that some
assistance can be provided by
[contacting the community](../Support/Converse). Some valid (and encouraged!) 
 example reasons to open an issue:
     * Found a bug
     * Framework/language README information out of date
 * Add any appropriate labels/milestone tags for easier identification.
 * If the issue is regarding this documentation, see the
 [about documentation page](../About/Documentation).
 
 # TFB Wiki
 * The preferred method for suggesting the implementation of a new framework or
language is adding it to the [TFB Wiki - Suggested Frameworks, Languages and
Features](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/wiki/Suggested-Frameworks,-Languages-and-Features)
Page.
